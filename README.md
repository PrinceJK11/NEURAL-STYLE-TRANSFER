# üé® Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project performs **Neural Style Transfer** using a pre-trained VGG-19 network from PyTorch‚Äôs `torchvision.models`. The goal is to blend the *content* of one image with the *style* of another to create a visually artistic result.

## üì∏ Example

<p align="center">
  <img src="stylized_output.jpg" alt="Stylized Output" width="500"/>
</p>

## üß† What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer is a technique that uses deep neural networks to combine two images:
- **Content Image** ‚Äì The subject of the final image.
- **Style Image** ‚Äì The artistic style to apply to the content.

This implementation is based on the paper [*A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style* by Gatys et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

## üöÄ Features

- Uses a pre-trained VGG-19 model for feature extraction.
- Separates style and content losses.
- Optimizes input image using L-BFGS algorithm.
- Supports GPU acceleration via CUDA.
- Modular and easy to customize.

## üß© Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL (Pillow)

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Clone the repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer-pytorch.git
cd neural-style-transfer-pytorch
Place your images

Replace the default images with your own:

content.jpg ‚Äì The image whose structure you want to preserve.

style.jpg ‚Äì The artwork whose style you want to emulate.

Place them in the project directory (or update the paths accordingly in the script).

Run the script

bash

python style_transfer.py
This will:

Load and preprocess the images

Perform the style transfer

Save and display the result as stylized_output.jpg

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can modify the following parameters in the script:

python

num_steps = 300            # Number of optimization steps
style_weight = 1_000_000   # Importance of style
content_weight = 1         # Importance of content
imsize = (512, 512)        # Resize input images


# Output
